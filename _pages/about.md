<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a full-time research assistant in the Future Laboratory at Tsinghua University, with an interdisciplinary background. I hold a Master’s degree in Design from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) and a Bachelor’s degree in Physics from [Heilongjiang University](https://www.hlju.edu.cn/). I am seeking opportunities to pursue a PhD starting in 2025 now!

I have conducted research at [Tsinghua University’s Future Laboratory](https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and [Arts and Machine Creativity, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/news/topic/arts-and-creativity), collaborated with [HUAWEI](https://www.huawei.com/en/) and [Xiaomi](https://www.mi.com/global/) on joint projects, and worked as a product manager intern at [DiDi](https://web.didiglobal.com/) and [Lenovo](https://www.lenovo.com/). These diverse academic and industry experiences have fueled my passion for the intersection of technology and design innovation and equipped me with strong interdisciplinary skills.

My research focuses on human-computer interaction, with particular interests in human-AI collaboration, haptic interaction, and system and user experience design. I am dedicated to exploring how technology can enhance user experiences and advance human-machine collaboration.
