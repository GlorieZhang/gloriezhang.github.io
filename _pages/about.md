# ü§πüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è About Me

I am currently **a full-time research assistant in the [Future Laboratory at Tsinghua University](https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/)**, with a interdisciplinary background. I hold **a Master‚Äôs degree in Design from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/)** and **a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Physics from [Heilongjiang University](https://www.hlju.edu.cn/)**. I am positively **seeking Ph.D. opportunities** starting in 2025 üöÄ and am passionate about advancing my research in human-computer interaction (HCI)!

I have conducted research at [Tsinghua University‚Äôs Future Laboratory](https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and [Arts and Machine Creativity at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://amc.hkust.edu.hk/), collaborated with [HUAWEI](https://www.huawei.com/en/) and [Xiaomi](https://www.mi.com/global/) on joint projects, and worked as a product manager intern at [DiDi](https://web.didiglobal.com/) and [Lenovo](https://www.lenovo.com/). These experiences have fueled my passion for integrating technology and design innovation while equipping me with interdisciplinary and practical skills. 

My research focuses on **HCI**, with particular interests in **human-AI collaboration, multimodal interaction, haptic interaction, and system and user experience design**. I am dedicated to exploring how technology can enhance user experiences and foster effective human-machine collaboration.

Beyond research, I enjoy mountain climbing, hiking, cycling, and playing badminton. In my free time, I‚Äôve also taken up dancing (including hip-hop, K-pop, and jazz) and playing drum sets. I‚Äôm an energetic üî• and curious üåç person who loves exploring new ideas and challenges.

If you‚Äôre interested in my research or share any of these hobbies, feel free to reach out to me: **gloriezhang777@gmail.com**.
